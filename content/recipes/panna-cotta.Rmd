Panna Cotta is a perfect dessert. It's not too sweet or heavy. It looks and tastes elegant, and it's surprisingly simple to make. I've experimented with several different panna cotta recipes and found that getting it perfect simply comes down to nailing the *gelatin to dairy ratio.*

The consistency of panna cotta is important. You don't want it to be too firm, like a flan. You also don't want it to collapse into a swamp of thick milkiness (although it will still taste great, but this dish is also about looks). Personally, I like to get it just ever so slightly above the threshold where it devolves into a puddle - barely holding its structure and jiggily enough such that a gust of wind will get it grooving on your plate. This is the [Mendoza line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendoza_Line) of panna cotta. Rather than wax too much more poetically on this, I'll show you what I mean.

If you agree that this is the ideal consistency, follow the recipe exactly. If a firmer panna cotta is more your thing, add 10% more gelatin. Any less and you're swimming.

## Dairy

If you look at 10 different recipes, you'll find 10 different dairy combinations. I've played with a bunch and found that the best is a mixture of cream and whole milk, with a ratio of 2:1.5.

## Gelatin ratio

This is the key to the dish. I'll use 1 package of unflavored, powdered <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007Y3HM5C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007Y3HM5C&linkCode=as2&tag=timabe-20&linkId=5e7a848b0c29f99678ba1076105e8a76">Knox Gelatin</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=timabe-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B007Y3HM5C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, which comes out to 1 tablespoon and combine it with *3.5* cups of dairy. That's the ratio.

The rest of the recipe is pretty straightforward.

## Ingredients

Makes 8 panna cottas

* 2 cups heavy whipping cream (1 pint)
* 1.5 cups whole milk
* 1 package of powdered gelatin
* 4.5 tablespoons sugar
* Vanilla - just a few drops
* Kosher salt - a tiny pinch

If you want to plate your panna cotta like in the gif above
* 8 4oz Ramekins
* Canola oil

## Instructions

If plating, lightly oil your ramekins (otherwise they'll be difficult to remove).

Pour milk into saucepan and sprinkle gelatin on the surface. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes for the gelatin to hydrate.

Once getalin has hydrated, turn stove on to medium heat. Stir in sugar and pinch of salt. 

Stirring constantly, allow mixture to heat up. You only need to heat to 135-140 degrees fahrenheit. Once it has come up to heat, take off the stove and add heavy cream and vanilla. Stir for a few mintues, the mixture will thicken a bit.

At this point, it's done! Carefully fill each ramekin and put in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours.

To plate, run a thin paring knife along the ramekin's circumference. Place plate on top of ramekin, holding the two against each other, and rotate over so plate is on bottom. Give a medium "slap" to the top of the ramekin, and the panna cotta should slip out. Gently lift the ramekin off. 

## Flavors, sauces, etc.

Feel free to experiment with different panna cotta flavors. Some people like flavoring with lemon, chocolate, or coffee. I personally like to keep it simple. Sometimes I will make a fresh berry sauce, where I'll add a handful of raspberries or blackberries to a shallow saucepan and heat on low until they release their juices. Then I'll just strain out the seeds and, if it's needed, add a small sprinkle of sugar. I'll do this right after I make the panna cotta, and the sauce will thicken as it cools. Adding a sauce is another way to make this elegant dish even more impressive looking.
