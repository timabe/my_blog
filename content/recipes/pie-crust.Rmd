I don't eat a lot of desserts, so when I get an urge to make a pie, I always make this crust from scratch. This is an incredibly flaky pie crust. It takes a little bit of patience and a lot of butter. My recommendation to aspiring pie crust makers is to buy a few packages of butter, the kind that contain 4 sticks, and just keep them in the freezer. Frozen butter is the trick to a great pie crust.


Precise measurements is key in making pie crust. I used to use a recipe that called for 205 grams of butter, which is almost 2 sticks but not quite. I found that it was kind of annoying to have 1/5 a stick of frozen butter left over. Plus, cutting frozen butter is difficult and a little dangerous. So I scaled everything up to that the recipe is based on 2 full sticks of butter. I find that this makes more than enough dough to cover any conventional pie pan. In fact, you can cut this recipe in half, use just one stick of butter, and still cover a pie pan but you will literally be stretching it a bit too thin. Pies are special desserts, so I'd just go with the 2 stick recipe and toss out what you don't need. 

## Ingredients

* 1 stick or 115g butter (I use Challenge Butter as my preferred brand)
* 140 grams of flour
* 31 grams of ice water
* A small pinch of salt.

I use a digital kitchen scale to get my weights precise. You can get one for about $10 on amazon.

## Equipment

* Food Processor
* Rolling Pin
* Plastic Wrap
* Pie Pan
* Optional: Pie weights if you are blind baking. More on that below.

## Instuctions

### Make the dough

Weigh flour and add to food processor. Your food processor probably came with an attachment that looks like this, which you've probably never used. We're going to put it to use.

Attach the shredder and add the stick of butter. If it doesn't fit cut it in half lengthwise. Despite being a hard, frozen stick of butter, the shredder and power of the food processor will make it look like grated mozzarella. This is actually perfect for a flaky crust. The secret to flaky crust is to coat pieces of frozen butter in flour, not to mix the two. 

Once the butter is shredded, remove the shredder and use the regular food processor blade to pulse the mixture together until it looks like course crumbs. Add the salt and slowly pour in water, pulsing a few more times until it slightly tightens up. Words only do so much here, so check out a youtube video to get a better picture. [I like this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO-NJVJlq0c&t)

Transfer mixture to the counter and work very slightly into a round, flat disc. Do not over work. If it won't hold together, add a little more water. Once it's holding, wrap it in plastic and stick it in the fridge. It's too early to roll out, you need to let the gluten develop. Leave in the fridge for at least 2 hours, I generally shoot for 4.

### Roll out the dough

Take the dough out of the refrigerator. At this point it should be very stiff, and that's not always easy to work with. Let it sit on the counter for a few minutes and relax ever so slightly. You do not want the butter to start melting though - as I've mentioned the frozen butter coated in flour is the key to flake city. At that point, flour your surface lightly and roll it out with a rolling pin, flipping it as necessary. You're goal is to get a big circle that will more than fit your pie pan. Again, youtube is your friend with regards to technique, but one learning for me is to not try to angle your rolling pin all over the place. Just go back and forth, back and forth, and when you flip the dough over turn it 90 degrees. Get it to about 1/4 inch thick.

### Line your pie pan

Once dough is rolled out, use your rolling pin to lift dough off your surface. Imagine you've unrolled some wrapping paper and now you want to roll it back up. Take rolling pin with dough to your pie pan and unroll it. Press dough down along inner circumference. As for the overhanging dough, either fold it back in or trim it off, depending on the look and feel you're ultimately going for. You will get some shrinkage in the oven, so account for that. More on shrinkage prevention in the next step.

### Chill again before baking

Whether you're going to blind bake or not, chilling the dough after you've rolled it out prevents shrinkage. Put it back in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. 

### Optional: Blind Bake

Some pies, like my famous [blueberry](https://www.timabe.me/recipes/blueberry-pie) or [banana cream pie](https://www.timabe.me/recipes/banana-cream-pie), require a blind bake. A blind bake is when you bake the crust without any filling, and add the cooked filling right at the end.

To blind bake, poke holes with a fork in the bottom of your crust. Cut a piece of foil or parchment paper and lay it on the crust. Pour something heavy in - I use dried beans but pennies also work (or fancy pie weights from sur la table, but that's not necessary).

Bake at 425 for about 12 minutes. Remove pie weights and parchment/tin foil and continue baking another 5-10 minutes until crust turns golden brown. It will puff up a bit, but don't worry. It will deflate as it cools.

**Note**: I even blind blake for pies whose fillings also bake in the oven, like pumpkin pie. It makes a huge difference. Take a pumpkin pie for instance - without blind baking you're filling raw dough with a cold pumpkin custard. The custard will bake, but the dough remains somewhat raw. I find it's way more tasty and flaky if you give it a blind bake first.
