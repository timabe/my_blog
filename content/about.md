Greetings!


I'm Tim Abraham, a Bay Area based data scientist, amateur cook, and lover of reading and learning new things. Most recently, I was the head of Analytics at [expa](www.expa.com), an early stage startup studio in San Francisco. Before that, I spent time at a company called StumbleUpon (remember that!?) and was a founding member of the Growth Data Science team at Twitter. Currently, I do some advising and freelance work for [Vero](https://www.vero.co/) and [PodOp](https://podop.com/) and am always looking for interesting data projects to dive deep into. 

Here is where I try to do a little writing, a little data blogging, summarise what I've been reading, and write down my favorite recipes for posterity.

I was born in Oakland, CA and currently live right across the border in Berkeley.
