Hello and welcome!

<img align="left" src="img/headshot.jpg>

I'm the head of Analytics at [expa](www.expa.com), an early stage startup studio in San Francisco. Here is where I try to do a little writing, summarise what I've been reading, and talk shop about all things cooking.

I was born in Oakland, CA and currently live right across the border in Berkeley.
